# Neural Network practice
# Dog's breed detection and classification
This exercise is for practicing neural networks. Note that we have to use one of the types of neural networks to complete the task.
There are challenges such as image size adjustment, segmentation of training and test data for each dog breed, and pre-processing must be completed by the programmer.
The main issue is to distinguish different breeds of dogs from their images.
