# SVM and KNN classification
We are supposed to run the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) and SVM (Support Vector Machines) classification algorithms [on the following dataset](https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/dataset.php?cod=192).

we are allowed to sse the ready-made functions in the sklearn library to run the SVM algorithm.
The KNN algorithm must be fully implemented by the programmer without the use of ready-made functions.
Note that in the attached dataset there are challenges such as incomplete data management that you have to handle it.


the code is also available in [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HXXR7QRHPZ4MxE3f6FGyhcVraHX7hmY6?usp=sharing).
