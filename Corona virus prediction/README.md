# Corona virus detection
we were supposed to implement a regression model (linear and then polynomial) using the Gradient Descent algorithm to model the number of coronavirus total cases in Iran.
For this purpose, we could use the official data of active cases published by the World Health Organization (WHO).
I Wrote the code with Python using the NumPy framework as much as possible to perform matrix calculations.
With the help of polynomial regression, I found the best model to describe the behaviour of this disease.
I finally implemented my application as a notebook in [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SCo3LSPmeH3GRUsQDuOwY3cr3XflaN62?usp=sharing) and present my analysis of the results at the end of the file.
